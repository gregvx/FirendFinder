# FriendFinder
A Sample Dating Site

The site asks the user to answer 10 personality questions. I file on the server stores the responses to the same 10 questions from other users and a link to an image of the user. 
Once the user submits a form indicating the questions have been answered, an algorithym checks the existing users' answers to find the closest match.
If their were was more than one user that had the same score for a match (a tie), the algorithym would return the first user (the one appearing first in the file) to have achieved the tied score.
The app does not have existing users and instead uses made up answers from celebrities as means to demonstrate the functionality.
The app is deployed to Heroku, and can be viewed here. - automatic!
